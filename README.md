# GeetestCracker
## Introduction
GeetestCracker is a tool designed to bypass or automate the handling of Geetest captchas, especially the one that requires dragging the slider to the correct position. This tool is intended for auto daily sign-in to Hifini, a website to download music. I am currently working on solving the latest GeeTests(Since they changed it to clicking the characters in an image in the order given) and will update the tool as soon as I have a solution.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yuzuru5747/GeetestCracker.git
   python hifini_cracker_parallelled.py
